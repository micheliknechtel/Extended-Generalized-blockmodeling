# ILP Model for the Extended Generalized Blockmodeling 

This code is part of my thesis, where the research question is:

How to deal with the situations where an analyst has several relations types of relations for a set of actors. Thus, I propose an optimization model, which I call the extended generalized blockmodeling.

The main objective of extended generalized blockmodeling is to find the partition size and the set of patterns that has the best representation of the network structure.
